## Description
Week-1 code challenge.
The challenge consisted of three Toy problems listed below;
 - Challenge 1: Student grade generator
 - challenge 2: Speed Detector
 - challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
 ***

## Project set up
To access this project, you can fork and then clone or just clone directly to your local machine.
open your terminal using(ctrl + alt + T) got to the directory you cloned your repository, cd to that specific directory and open your code editor from there, the specific.js and other project files will open in your prefered code editor.
open the terminal in your code editor and run the following commands; 
 - run <code>npm initialise</code> and follow all the prompts to initialise your package.json file.
 - optional: adding npm testing using npm start in your package.json file 
 - run <code>npm install</code> to install node modules
 - run <code>npm insall propmt-sync</code> in the terminal once you have finished writing the code. 
To check if the different programs are runnig type <code>node 'fileName'.js</code> (replace 'fileName' with the specific filename you want to run eg to run netSalary.js code; node netsalary.js) and input your values when prompted.

## Challenge 1: Student grade generator

The code in this challenge prompts the user to input student marks. The input limits should be between 0 and 100. Then it prints out the output of the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

***
## Challenge 2: speedDetector
This is a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80 Km/hr. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (which is 70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
***
## Challenge 3: netSalary calculator

This a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.


## Imported Files

<code>const prompt = require("prompt-sync")();</code>
const prompt is used to allow the user to input their values and check how well the code is running.
